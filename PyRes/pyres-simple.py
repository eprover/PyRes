"""
Usage: pyres-simple.py <problem_file>

This is a straightforward implementation of a simple resolution-based
prover for first-order clausal logic. Problem files should be in
(restricted) TPTP-3 CNF syntax. Unsupported features include double
quoted strings and include file. Equality is parsed, but not
interpreted.

Options:

 -h
--help
