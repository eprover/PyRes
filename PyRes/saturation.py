# Module saturation.py

"""
Implementation of the given-clause algorithm for saturation of clause
sets under the rules of the resolution calculus. This improves on the
very basic implementation in simplesat in several ways.

- It supports heuristic clause selection, not just first-in first-out
- It supports tautology deletion
- It supports forward and backwards subsumption
- It keeps some statistics to enable the user to understand the
  practical impact of different steps of the algorithm better.

Most of these changes can be found in the function processClause() of
the ProofState class.

% English  : Someone who lives in Dreadbury Mansion killed Aunt Agatha.
%            Agatha, the butler, and Charles live in Dreadbury Mansion,
%            and are the only people who live therein. A killer always
%            hates his victim, and is never richer than his victim.
%            Charles hates no one that Aunt Agatha hates. Agatha hates
%            everyone except the butler. The butler hates everyone not
%            richer than Aunt Agatha. The butler hates everyone Aunt
%            Agatha hates. No one hates everyone. Agatha is not the
%            butler. Therefore : Agatha killed herself.
